# Explanation about the protocol

- Connexus Protocol - Loan with collateral in RWA (Real World Assets). We use ERC6551 (TBA) as a customer card, which provides greater security and interoperability. The contracts aim to be implemented on several Blockchains, especially on Bitifinity and DREX (Hyperledger Besu). 

- Note. We implemented it on the Sepolia network as it is the most suitable test network for ideal operation and demonstration with verified contracts.

- There were 11 days of challenge and 9 smart contracts implemented. Details of smart contracts can be found at: [Connexus-contracts](https://github.com/connexus-team/connexus-contracts)
